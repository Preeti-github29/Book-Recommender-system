Book Recommender system
The Book Recommender System is a machine learning project designed to recommend books to users based on their reading history and preferences. The system uses collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods to provide accurate and personalized book recommendations.

Features
Personalized book recommendations
Collaborative filtering using user-item interaction data

To install and run the Book Recommender System, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-recommender-system.git
cd book-recommender-system
2.Create a virtual environment and activate it
3.Install the required dependencies
Usage
Prepare the dataset:
Place your dataset files in the specified (make sure to keep it where your scripts are, otherwise specify the location) directory. Ensure the dataset contains information on users, books, and user-book interactions.
Here we have three datasets - 
BOOKS
RATINGS
USERS
Model Training
The model training process involves the following steps:

Data loading and preprocessing
Splitting the data into training and test sets
Training the collaborative filtering model (e.g., matrix factorization)
Training the content-based filtering model
Saving the trained model for future use USING the pickle file method.
Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the recommender system, use metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Precision, Recall, and F1-score. The evaluation script will compute these metrics and provide a detailed report.

Contributing
We welcome contributions to improve the Book Recommender System. To contribute:

Fork the repository.
Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature-branch).
Make your changes and commit them (git commit -m 'Add new feature').
Push to the branch (git push origin feature-branch).
Create a pull request.

Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the open-source community for their contributions to various libraries and datasets used in this project. Special thanks to the creators of the datasets (USED FROM KAGGLE) used for training and evaluating the recommender system.
